							<p>Because I am an Army researcher, some of my projects are sensitive. I have done my best to include as much

									<h3>RAPID - Ready Armor Protection for Instant Deployment</h3>
								</header>

								<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/RAPID.jpeg.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							
								<p>I am a co-inventor of the patented barrier system RAPID which stands for Ready Armor Protection for Instant Deployment.
								The RAPID barrier system is a blast, ballistic, and vehcile threat mitigation barrier that operates in urban environments.
								As an intern, I designed the first 3-D CAD models of the system and as a Research Engineer, I oversaw production of the first 
								prototypes and then the final verison of the product. I led and assited in the blast, ballistic, and vehcile threat mitigation 
								testing and published two technical reports and one submitted journal article with the research findings.  U.S. Patent No. 10,775,138
								A video with more information about the RAPID system can be found at the following link: 
									<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL2PmP0-gFk">RAPID system overview</a>

									<h3>Confidential Project #1</h3>
								</header>
							
								<p>I led a project funded by the Army to design an unconvential protection system that obfuscated enemy 
									intelligence. I first designed the system in the 3-D CAD software Solidworks and then lead 
									production of the prototype. I machined all major componets of the protective system. 
									We conducted research and experimentation with new finishing techniques
									so that the protection system could operate effectively in harsh environments.

									<h3>Confidential Project #2</h3>
								</header>
							
								<p>I am co-leading a project funded by the Marines to design an unconvential protection system that obfuscated enemy 
									intelligence. I first designed the system in the 3-D CAD software Solidworks and then oversaw 
									production of the prototype. After testing the prototype we found that the first iteration was unsuccesful in 
									meeting mission objectives. We then had to modify the protection system and we plan to reevaluate its
									effectiveness in the coming months.

									<h3>Confidential Project #3</h3>
								</header>
							
								<p>I am leading a project funded by the Army to design an unconvential protection system that obfuscated enemy 
									intelligence. I first designed the system in the 3-D CAD software Solidworks and am working with technican
									specialists that will assist in the prototyping phase of the protection system. This will be a huge prototyping 
									effort where I will take on most of the CNC machining and I will oversee all phases of production.

									<h3>Dog Harness</h3>
								</header>

								<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/dogharness.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
							
								<p>I made a dog harness because as a father, I am always trying to figure out ways to make my life
									easier. The harness is made from PVC pipe and climbing rope. While the harness works great, the wagon was 
									made for offroad surfaces so the ride at times can be a bit rough, which the kids seem to enjoy.

								<h2>About Me</h2>

							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/all family1.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							

							<p>I am a Research Mechanical Engineer for the U.S. Amry Research and Development Center (ERDC). I have been with ERDC 
								for 6 years in total, and have loved every minute of it. I have worked primarly in designing blast and ballistic mitigation
								barriers, and prototyping of unconvential protection systems. I graduated from Brigham Young University - Idaho with a 
								Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering and am hoping to continue my education in Rapid Prototyping. 
								I am from Clinton, Mississippi and my wife and I are proud parents 
								of 2 amazing boys. I love playing soccer, pickleball, traveling, spending time with my family and going to church.
